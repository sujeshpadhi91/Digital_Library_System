# Digital_Library_System
A Digital Library System for the students is a software that extends the library functionality and accessibility as a convenient solution beyond papers and in-person arrangements.

The Digital Library System is made on the framework of JADE and has 3 main modules. Printer Station, Stationery Station and Library. Each module is built as an agent and they all work together communicating based on the FIPA specifications. 

In order to avail the services the student needs to register to the Digital Library System and only then the student can utilize the services of the the library system. 

Using the library system the student can borrow/return the book, buy items from the stationery station and print pages using the printer station.
